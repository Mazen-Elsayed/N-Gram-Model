I did like the lead actors, but thought little of the film. <nl>  <nl> One intriguing sequence. Early on, the guys are supposed to get \"de-loused\" and for about three minutes, fully dressed, do some schtick. In the background, perhaps three dozen men pass by, all naked, white and black (WWI ?), and for most, their butts, part or full backside, are shown.

This film represents a bunch of good natured friends and neighbors coming together to collaborate on an interesting project. If your cousin had been one of those involved, you would probably think to yourself, \"ok, this movie is terrible... but a really good effort.\" For all the poorly delivered dialog and ham-fisted editing, \"Time Chasers\" has great scope and ambition... and one can imagine it was necessary to shoot every scene in only one or two takes. So, I\\'m suggesting people cut \"Time Chasers\" some slack before they cut in the jugular.
